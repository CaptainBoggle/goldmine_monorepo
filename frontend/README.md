This is a placeholder for the frontend, it is just something i threw together quickly to test the backend API.
Feel free (and encouraged) to redesign the frontend stack, run configurations, etc. I have no idea if nginx is actually good for this it
was just the first google result that came up.

Oh, also, I totally forgot but we could consider using streamlit for frontend instead of react. It has a lot of built-in features for data vis and is very easy to set up. Also take a look at weights and biases, we might want to use that somehow.
